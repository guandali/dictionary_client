The idea of implementing a client of dictionary is easy to understand, but "RFC 2229" took time 
to read(Around 2 hours). Especially test command lines on terminal to figure out format and meaning of messages sent 
from server. The actual implementation takes around 12 hours.
What we learned from this assignment:
1. Gained a good insight into socket programming as well as use of printWriter.
2. Experienced how to read a protocols and implement application level protocols
3. This assignment also improved our debugging skills.
